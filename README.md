# Blog Code Refactoring

## Project Description
In this project, I refactored a blog's HTML and CSS code, You can find The original code in the (`oldCode.html`) file, and I improved its structure, design, and user experience.
The key improvements include:

- **Semantic HTML**: Restructured the HTML in `oldCode.html`, ensuring it follows semantic HTML5 practices for better accessibility and readability.
  
- **Optimized CSS**: Improving the CSS by moving it to an external file, removing unnecessary code, using variables, and simplifying the stylesheet, making it more efficient and maintainable.
  
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Adjusted the design using Bootstrap components instead of custom elements.
  
- **Additions and Enhancement**: Added a "scroll to top" button that appears when scrolling and implemented a responsive navigation menu.

  
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
